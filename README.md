# Projects

This repo is a place to gather all the coding projects I work on in my freetime. Currently, the projects I am working on/have completed are:

- __xg_analysis__: A class I created to easily visualise expected goals (xG) values for all teams from the Big 5 leagues (English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A and French Ligue 1) for any season from 2017-2018 (data on xG is not available before this season).
- __strava_airflow__: An Apache Airflow pipeline I developed to automatically grab data on my runs using the Strava API

More information on how each project works is given in the folders associated with their name.
