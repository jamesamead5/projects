# Projects

This repo is a place to gather all the coding projects I work on in my freetime. Currently, the projects I am working on/have completed are:

- xg_analysis: A class I created to easily visualise expected goals (xG) values for Premier League teams.
- strava_airflow: An Apache Airflow pipeline I developed to automatically grab data on my runs using the Strava API

More information on how each project works is given in the folders associated with their name.
